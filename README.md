# How far is the metro? STM walking access in Montréal

An interactive web map of the 68 STM metro stations in Montréal. It is the first step toward showing which areas of the city are within a 5-minute walk of a metro station.

Made for GEOG 464 (Programming for Geospatial Technologies) at Concordia University, A2 MVP.

## The project in five sentences

1. **Problem:** A metro station can look close on a map, but the real walk can be long or blocked by barriers like highways.
2. **Audience:** Students and residents in Montréal who want to know how easy it is to walk to the metro, for example when choosing where to live.
3. **Core action:** They can click a metro station to see its line and whether it is wheelchair accessible.
4. **Data:** STM open data on metro stations (GTFS stops), processed in a Python notebook into GeoJSON.
5. **Why it matters:** Walking access to the metro shapes who can easily use public transit, and this map is a first step toward showing which neighbourhoods are left out.

## Research question

_Which parts of Montréal are within a 5-minute walk (about 500 m) of a metro station, and which neighbourhoods are left out?_
(This MVP shows the stations; walking distances come in the next version.)

## How to run

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Run `notebooks/[your notebook name].ipynb` from top to bottom (Restart → Run All). It writes `data/metro_stations.geojson`.
3. Right-click `site/index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

## Data

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `data/MetroStops.geojson` | Input: 68 metro stations from the STM GTFS stops, filtered to metro stations (location type 1) in QGIS |
| `data/MetroStops.shp` (+ `.dbf`, `.shx`, `.prj`, `.cpg`) | The same layer as a shapefile, exported from QGIS |
| `data/metro_stations.geojson` | Output: written by the notebook and loaded by the map |

## Method

1. Downloaded the STM GTFS data and filtered it to metro stations in QGIS (68 stations).
2. In the notebook, read the GeoJSON into a table and cleaned it: kept only metro stations, dropped rows with no coordinates (0 dropped), renamed columns to plain words (`station`, `line`, `wheelchair_access`), turned wheelchair codes 1/2 into Yes/No, and worked out the metro line from the stop ID (M1 = Green, M2 = Orange, M4 = Yellow, M5 = Blue).
3. The notebook writes `data/metro_stations.geojson`, and a check cell tests the count (68), that every point is inside Montréal, and that every station has its properties.
4. The Leaflet page in `site/` loads that file and shows a popup for each station.

## Testing

- **Check cell:** my first run wrote 0 features and overwrote my input file, because the loop was still the empty lab template and the output path pointed to the input file. The feature count showed the problem. I fixed the loop and now write to a separate output file, `metro_stations.geojson`. The check cell now passes with 68 stations.
- **Stranger test:** [optional: what someone did when they used it, and what you changed]

## Not in this iteration

- **5-minute walking areas and real walk times:** need a walking network (Google API), which I have not finished yet.
- **Nearby places (grocery stores, restaurants, hospitals) and barriers:** need a second dataset; planned for later.
- **One borough focus:** I kept the whole metro network to keep the pipeline simple. Next, I will focus on Côte-des-Neiges–NDG, where many students live and the Décarie expressway creates walking barriers (for example near Namur station).
- **Transfer stations:** stations like Berri-UQAM and Lionel-Groulx appear under one line only, because that is how the STM file stores them.

## Next step

Add 5-minute walking areas around each station so the popup can show which stations have better walking access.

## Project structure


## Layer 2: Grocery stores within 500 m of each metro station

**How it was computed:** In my notebook, I drew a 500 m buffer around each STM metro station and counted the grocery stores from the City of Montréal's food establishments data (receipt below) that fall inside it. Before counting, I filtered the data in QGIS to keep only grocery stores. The count is stored as `within_500m` in `MetroGrocery500m.geojson`.

**Grocery data receipt**
- **Title and publisher:** *Établissements alimentaires* (Food establishments), Ville de Montréal

- **Date accessed:** October 23, 2026
- **What I changed:** The download has 54,783 food establishments of all kinds (restaurants, daycares, vending machines, etc.). In QGIS, I filtered the `type` field to keep only grocery stores ([TYPES YOU KEPT, e.g., Épicerie, Supermarché]) and saved the result as a new layer.

**Total check:** The layer has [N] stations, the same as `MetroStops.geojson` ([N]), so no station was dropped. A store near two stations is counted for both, so the counts are not meant to add up to the [TOTAL] grocery stores in the source data.

## Reading the map

Darker circles are metro stations with more grocery stores within 500 m of the station, measured in a straight line.
